### Implementation notes

Note 1 - Stock symbols are hardcoded in StockMarketQueryService      private String[] symbols = new String[] {"INTC", "BABA", "TSLA", "AIR.PA", "MSFT", "AAPL", etc.}; You can add your own symbol as long as correspond to some real market symbols.

Note 2 - For getting financial market information the application uses htmlunit library, which consumes the Yahoo Finance API:

        <dependency>
            <groupId>net.sourceforge.htmlunit</groupId>
            <artifactId>htmlunit</artifactId>
            <version>2.70.0</version>
        </dependency>
